### Why are handwritten programs inappropriate for solving
machine learning task such a 3D object recognition?

```
- [x] There are too variations  of inputs/outputs pairs to articulate directly.
- [-] Handwritten programs are compiled down to machine instructions.
- [-] Handwritten programs can only recognize 2D objects.
- [-] Handwritten programs don't have enough numbers.
```

### What characteristics are evidence that suggest a handwritten '2'?

```
- An upside-down U-shaped stroke at the top.
- A little loop in the bottom left.
- A tail in the bottom right
- in a 28x28 image, the pixel at position (5,14) Agenda (20,14)
  being on (11,26) being off.
```

```
All of these can be considered correct (althought they may not
always occur together in many examples). It is very difficult
to article in many in natural language all of the variations of
a handwritten '2'. It is also difficult to state directly in
terms of pixel states. This becomes even more complicated
tasks such as object recognition.
